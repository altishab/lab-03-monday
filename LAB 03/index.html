        <h2> Buisness Opportunity:</h2>
        <p1>
            I have a ton of Buisness Oppurtunity's but there is one that stands out the most to me. I was thinking about
            what is the best way to actually create something that has a chance competing with todays technology. I
            realized there was a huge audience for keyboard building. But there is no way to test anything about a
            keyboard. Everything about a Keyboard is the way the keyboard sounds. So I had come up with this idea for an
            IOS app where you can customize your own keyboard and listen to what it would sound like in real life. If
            you like it you could purchase a customized keyboard through the app and if you don't like it you can
            customize it to what you want.

        <h2>Complaint:</h2>
        <p2>
            I'd like to complain about how inflation has messed everything up. I personally was going to be buying my
            self a car
            but the prices for cars have gone up like 70% all cause of inflation. Food it self is also more expensive
            then it
            should be. I remember I used to get a junior chicken at McDonalds for around 1$, they now cost 3$ each. And
            grocerys
            are also super expensive now I always see videos of people complaining how expensive it is on Instagram.
        </p2>

        <h2> General Query:</h2>
        <p3>I'd like to just talk about what my plans are for the next few weeks. I am a little behind in school I had
            no idea
            it would be this much work but Im definetly going to catch up. Once im done with that im going to sell my
            desktop to
            my friend and with the money I recieve im going to combine it with some money I have left over and build a
            super
            good desktop. After that I think I am going to finally buy a car but the prices are a little bit too high
            right now.
            I also plan to fully renovate my entire room and paint my walls light blue or something.
        </p3>
